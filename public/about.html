<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate computer science student who enjoys solving problems and building strong fundamentals in programming. My primary focus is on Data Structures and Algorithms, and I regularly practice competitive programming using C++ to improve my logical thinking and efficiency.

<p>I like breaking down complex problems into simple solutions and learning the “why” behind every approach. Through consistent practice on platforms like CodeChef and Codeforces, I aim to sharpen my problem-solving skills and write clean, optimized code.

<p>I’m currently working on strengthening my core CS concepts and exploring opportunities to apply my skills to real-world projects. I believe in continuous learning, curiosity, and improving a little every day as a developer.</p>
